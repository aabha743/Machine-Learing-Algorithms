# About Logistic Regression
Logistic regression predicts the probability of a binary outcome using predictor variables. It uses a logistic function to map inputs to probabilities between 0 and 1. The model's coefficients are estimated from training data. A confusion matrix summarizes the model's performance, showing true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives. Performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score can be calculated from the confusion matrix. Logistic regression is widely used for binary classification tasks.
