# KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors Classfication)
Like the name suggests, this is a classification algorithm that helps us group data points into various clusters based on their distance from each other. The closer the point is from the point of detection/classification, the higher the chance of the point getting classified into that cluster.
This is one of the simplest clustering algorithms used in machine learning.<br>
The first notebook of this folder is knn_1.ipynb, it has the most basic way of implementing this algorithm where I have used datasets directly from the sklearn library!!<br>
The second notebook has a much detailed, step-bystep approach of the algorithm where we go through the whole process of understanding the dataset through both exploration and visualisation. I hope it will help you :) <br> Happy Learning!
