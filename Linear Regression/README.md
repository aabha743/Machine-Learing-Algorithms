# Linear_regression
This repository is for anybody to use to learn and understand Linear regression.
This repository has three Jupyter Notebooks out of which there are two notebooks that work using scikit learn.
The 3rd notebook has the execution of linear regression using numpy for better understanding of the working of the Linear Regression algorithms.
# About Linear Regression
It is the simpleast statistical regression method which is used for making predictions. 
For a beginner, learning and understanding the working of linear regression for making predictions can help the student/programmer gain insights on how Machine Learning works. 
It uses a linear approach of fitting a straight line through our dataset inorder to understand the flow of data and make predictions accordingly.<br>
The formula used in linear regression is: y=mx+c<br>
The formula used to evaluate the accuracy of the algorithm, we use the R-squared formula:<br> 
R 2 = 1 − ∑ ( y i − y i ^ ) 2 ∑ ( y i − y ¯ ) 2
